    "The goal of today is to use Dimentionality Reduction technics on whole-brain data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Dimentionality Reduction ?**  \n",
    "The goal of Dimentionality Reduction (DR) is to transform data which has $D$ dimentions into a new space of dimention $d$ with $d<D$. We will refer to any such transformation as $D→d$.  \n",
    "DR spans everything from simple averaging, up to very complex Machine Learning algorithms which are completly out of the scope of this tutorial. We are going to focus on a few intermidiary methods which are conceptually relatively complicated, but which are very easy to use in practice.  \n",
    "You will see that the biggest problem with DR is not the programming itself (because most of the time you will use librairies which already exist) but **the biggest problem is how to interpret the results !** Hence this tutorial is not going to involve a lot of programming, but will instead focus on building your understanding of DR methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we use Dimentionality Reduction**  \n",
    "First of all when you have thousands of neurons it can be very very hard to get an intuition of what is happening in the data. A good way of solving this problem is to reduce the dimensionality to something which can be plotted in 2D or 3D.   \n",
    "Another important use case of DR is to find emerging properties in your data. A lot of interesting dynamics/properties do not happen at the scale of individual neurons, but happen instead at the scales of groups of neurons or perhaps the entire brain. Some DR methods allow you to identify those emerging properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During this tutorial, we will use the following markers :\n",
    "- ➡️👤⌨️ : shows you what/were you need to code yourself.\n",
    "- 💡 : shows hints to help you if you need it.\n",
    "- ❗ : shows important notes.\n",
    "- ⚠️ : shows warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "❗ We remind you that at any time, you can run `?thing` to get the documentation for `thing`. Typicaly, this is useful if `thing` is a function, and you need to know what are its parameters and/or what it does."
